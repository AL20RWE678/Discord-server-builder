# Discord server builder
Discord-server-builder (until I'll find a good name 😄) is a simple program to create and manager your discord server fast.


## ⁉ WHY 
Well, you may say: "there are already templates in Discord!".
Thats true but there are other reasons to do that:
Mainly, I want to try and learn Git. I have never really used it before so it could be a good way to learn. 
BUT, today Discord bots have become a standard in Discord servers. Most of the people, don't want to mess around with stuff like that, so THIS self bot could help them setup stuff much much faster. 
Also, this bot allows combination of templates, changing them and customizing them with a few simple commands.
(And for developers, there's a very weird API, so you can easily create plugins).

## 💾 Installation 

##### ⌨ Windows
1. Download & install [Python](https://python.org/) | Make sure to add Python to your PATH!!!
2. Run [install.bat](./install.bat) (This will setup [pip](https://pypa.io/) and the dependencies needed automatically for you.)

##### 🐧 Linux
Instructions coming soon . . . But I think you already know what to do ;)

## 🌈 Usage
[Find your discord token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qzpmTIQ-Gs) and edit [config.json](./config.json).
Run [main.py](./main.py), aaaannnddd DONE!

## ❕ Important 
I'm not a professional programmer and the code could be messy. I hope to improve it in later [versions](#versions).

## ❄ Versions
I don't know how to name versions, so, I'll try my best :)
