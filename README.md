# Discord server builder
Discord-server-builder (until I'll find a good name) is a simple program to create and manager your discord server fast.


## WHY
Well, you may say: "there are already templates in Discord!".
Thats true but there are other reasons to do that:
Mainly, I want to try and learn Git. I have never really used it before so it could be a good way to learn. 
BUT, today Discord bots have become a standard in Discord servers. Most of the people, don't want to mess around with stuff like that, so THIS self bot could help them setup stuff much much faster. 
Also, this bot allows combination of templates, changing them and customizing them with a few simple commands.
(And for developers, there's a very weird API, so you can easily create plugins).

## Installation
##### Windows
1. Download & install [Python](https://python.org/) | Make sure to add Python to your PATH!!!
2. Run install.bat (This will setup [pip](https://pypa.io/) and the dependencies needed automatically for you.)

##### Linux
Coming soon, but generally you need to install python:
sudo apt install python3
-or-
sudo pacman -Sy  python3

## Usage
[Find your discord token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qzpmTIQ-Gs) and edit config.json.
Run [main.py](./main.py), aaaannnddd DONE!

## Important
I'm not a professional programmer and code could be messy. I hope to improve it in later versions.

## Versions
I don't know how to name versions, so, I will do what I think is the best way to name them.
